#Design Patterns in Javascript Lang

*The design patterns are a way to write the code, standarized by programmers to repeat the same patterns or code, but with good practices, is a complex theme, and there are a lot of new patterns, it depends of the paradigm programmers use to write awesome code.*

Such as design patterns exists, there are anti patterns, accord to one theory the good patterns were made using bad practices.

In this case i decide to explore design patterns in javascript, to improve my code and see how to implement different kinds of design patterns in this language.

##Types of design patterns

In javascript there is three types of design patterns accord to popular books in the topic:

**Creational:**Those patterns give instructions about how to create objects, and other elements of the language.
**Structural:**Describes the components of one structure as a pattern, for example MVC (Model View Controller), MVT (Model View Template), MVP (Model View Presenter).
**Behavioral:**Those kind of design patterns describe and control the behavior of one component, for example: observer, facade.
